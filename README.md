# Coded Project .Net #

Requires use of Visual Studio 2022 (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads) and the .NET 6.0 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)  



### Objective ###

The goal is to add missing functionality to an existing ASP.NET web application.  

### Required Functionality ###
  
Check if the entered email already exists in the database.  
Add the entered email to the database and the current user's session.  
Get the email from the current user's session.  

### Additional Considerations ###
  
Here, we are hoping to see demonstration of an understanding of the following:  
  
Model-View-Controller Architecture  
Entity Framework  
HTML  
Javascript (jQuery)  
SCSS/CSS (Bootstrap)  
ASP.NET Lifecycle Management  
Dependency Injection
